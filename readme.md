# Getting to grips with algorithms Part 4 in Practical Python

This covers the "Boggle Solver" part one and two.

## Boggle Solver

Boggle is a word game where the player composes as many words a possible in a given time using a grid of letters.
In Boggle there are 16 dice with six different letters on each, you connect the letters to form word using each letter just once.
The rules of Boggle state that a letter can be connected with any of its neighbors (vertically, horizontally or diagonally).

In this lesson I will learn how to create an algorithm that can find all words in the grid using a dictionary file.

I will make the grid larger and make the algorithm more efficient

## Learning outcome

### Part one

    - Creating an algorithm,
    - Understanding approprate Data Structures and Collections,
    - Tests before code,
    - Recursion

### Part two

    - Algorithm efficiency, 
    - Profiling, 
    - The right data structure, 
    - Partial words
